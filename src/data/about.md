My name is `Ashal Farhan Wadjo`, you can call me Ashal, or Farhan, it depends if you already have a friend named Farhan or Ashal. But I'm comfortable with both.

I was born in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia. My last education is just high school, specifically `Vocational High School`, with `Airframe and Powerplant` Major ✈️ ⚙️.

My journey started in an online learning platform, called [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I learn about basic `Web Development` such as `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. After I completed some of the course in `freeCodeCamp`, my `Mentor` ask me to join an internship program in an agency that he lead.
