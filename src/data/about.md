My name is Ashal Farhan Wadjo, you can call me Ashal, or even Farhan, it depends if you already have a friend named Farhan or Ashal üòÑ. But i'm comfortable with both name. I was born in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia. All of my education i've finished are in Sidoarjo. My last education is high school, specifically Vocational High School, with Airframe and Powerplant Major ‚úàÔ∏è ‚öôÔ∏è.

Currently I'm about a year in my Software Engineering Career, it started in August, 2020 after i graduated from my vocational high school, i was worried about how can i get a job with my last education, but someone told me that in this industry i can have a good job if i want to learn. So i decided to begin my journey, and i really love it.

My journey started in an online Bootcamp, called [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). I learn about basic Web Development such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's really cool that i can learn that for free. There are a lot of course that i've completed most of them are related to Frontend Development, but a few for Backend Development. After i complete some of the course in freeCodeCamp, my mentor ask me to join an internship program in his agency that he lead.
