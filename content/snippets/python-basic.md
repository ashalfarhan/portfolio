If you're on Unix like system (`macOS`, `linux`) then python interpreter should already installed.

Check the version

```sh
$ python --version
```

> If you get an error in your terminal, try to use python3 instead.

```sh
$ python3 --version
```

## Syntax

Python can just run the code without any main function or something like that.

```python
# hello.py
print("Hello from python!")
```

Then run it with

```sh
$ python hello.py
```
