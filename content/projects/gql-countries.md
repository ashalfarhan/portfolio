## Overview

GQL Countries is a clone of [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) but instead of `REST`, this built with `GraphQL` on top of `Node.js`. The functionality is almost the same, with additional features like filtering, and limiting the result. That was my concern to rebuild the API, so that I can retrive the data partially (only the fields that I want to read), and not bloated in the Frontend Side.

## Technologies

- GraphQL Library: [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
