## Coronavirus Tracker

A Coronavirus Dashboard Tracker, this will show you about the Coronavirus statistic in some countries in the universe ðŸš€.

Technologies used are Gatsby, and consuming Disease API for the single source of truth.

I was develop this for about a month from my internship for the first time. Also my first time for using gatsby as my static site generation.
