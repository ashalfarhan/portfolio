This project is just a clone of [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/) but this time I built with Graphql. The framework that I use is [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/). Total time taken for this project is quite fast, because I decided to just fetch the data from `restcountries` so that I don't need to manage any database. But ya, it's kinda bad idea to have data source that depends on the other service.
