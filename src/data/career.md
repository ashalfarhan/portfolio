## A brief about my career

I do Frontend Development with a lot of passion, works for office by day, and do personal project and learning by night. High
interest in learning new things related to the world of web development.

I really love to write TypeScript, and library for building UI I often use is React.js. Also for state management that I'm
using are Redux, Recoil, and React Query for Server state management.

Other technologies that make my life easier are Graphql, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Chakra-UI. And I'm still learning Backend
development with Node.js and Go. Building a command line interface (CLI), a simple REST API, working with Database (PostgreSQL and Mongo DB), Docker for containerize my app and more.
