This built using MERNG Stack, and my first time creating a Graphql API with [Apollo](https://apollographql.com), learning how authentication flow works with JSON Web Token (JWT), but i'm only using the access token, haven't implement the refresh token yet.

Database used is Mongo DB, i'm using Mongo DB [Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com) as the Cloud Database, the reasons are:

1. Mongo DB is a No SQL Database that is really works well with JavaScript (Node.js in this case), and with the help of [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) as a Document Modeling and that will make my work a lot easier, because i don't have to worry about creating id whenever creating a collection, and inserting them, and parsing from string to ObjectId, and also there are a lot of method that mongoose provided and it helps me to done this faster.

2. This is my first time doing Backend World, and at that time, i don't know how to deal with database migration, at all. So Cloud Database like Mongo DB Atlas is the best option i think.

This App is mostly written with TypeScript, and i really enjoy working on this project. And also learning how to work with i18n in the Frontend Side.
